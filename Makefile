# This repo is a library: the only reachability roots are examples/ and (via

# calls is reported as dead. That is intentional: new exported funcs must ship
# with a test or an example. Exported types, constants and variables are NOT
# covered by this tool. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
#
# deadcode exits zero even when it finds something, so fail on any output. The
# -f template emits GitHub workflow commands so findings show up as inline
# annotations on the PR diff; locally they are still readable.
# Example functions without an "Output:" comment are compiled and never run,
# which is the point of them: they document an API that needs a live server
# and the compiler keeps them honest. Nothing calls them, so deadcode is
# right and useless here; drop only those, matched on the test file and the
# Example prefix together so a real finding cannot hide behind the filter.
# deadcode exits zero when it finds something, so the findings are read from
# its output. That makes its exit status the only signal that it ran at all:
# a tool that dies prints nothing, and nothing would otherwise read as "no
